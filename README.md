# StudentDB
Keep student project and exam results.
Written in C++ on a Linux platform using CodeBlocks.
Program asks for Student's ID and Name then it askes for their marks.
This is a very simple project that is a learning tool for me.  
Your comments and any assistance and recomendations are certainly welcome.
The project is strictly text based - no fancy windows and virtually no error checking.
There are four menus that offer simple choices.  
I have also put some required setup files in that are needed to make the program run.
There is also a sample .dat file.
